		<h1>Overview</h1>
		<article>
			<p
				>Old Town San Diego is the birthplace of modern San Diego. It's
				history could be traced back through thoundsands of years of
				Native American history.</p
			>
			<p
				>What is particularly interesting is the drop of population of
				the town during the Mexican period, which demonstrate an
				intersting effect of the ranchos area. With the ranchos so
				spread out, a central town become less of a population center
				and more of meeting places.</p
			>
			<p
				>Old Town struggle's against the New Town demonstrate the change
				of the use of the town. The bay become a much more important
				feature for the newer population. Old Town was established near
				the old presidio, where most of its original ranchos' family
				came from, but far away from the bay. So it was unsuitable and a
				New Town was developed and replaced it.</p
