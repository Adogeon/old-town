			<p
				>With the signing of the Treaty of Guadalupe in 1848, San Diego
				became an American Town. Its role also changed. Contrast with
				the Califonios, the new American settlers are intended to use
				the town not as just meeting place but also as a center of
				population.</p
			>
			<p
				>With that the Old Town location proved to be quite problematic.
				The rail road were taking their sweet time to arrive to this
				border town. The location of Old Town was far away from the
				bay.</p
			>
			<p
				>Newcommer to the area quickly understand the need to establish
				a town center nearer to the bay. This New Town eventually proven
				to be more succesfful and Old Town gruadually lost its
				significant.</p

				>James W. Robinson is the champion of bringing the railroad to
				San Diego. James arrived in San Diego with his wife and son in
				the Spring of 1850. In the seven years staying in San Diego, he
				proved to be an active citizen of the town. By trade, he was an
				attorney and eventually become the town judge. He also helped
				establish the Democratic Party in San Diego. James, however,
				devoted most of his energy in helping bringing the railroad to
				San Diego, especially a southern road follow the Gila trail. He
				believes that San Diego would be connected with the rest of
				America by railroad.
			</p>
			<p>
				For all of his energy, however, Judge James W. Robinson passed
				away in 1857. His dream of a railroad in San Diego didn't come
				true until much later after his time.</p

				him to San Diego</p

				>In 1869, Albert purchased the crunbling Bandini adobe and
				turned it into the two-story Cosmopolitan Hotel. With his
				partner, he contracted and reparied roades, cutting travel times
				and improving the run to Los Angeles. They also extended stage
				service to Julian. However, as railroad moved into the region,
				stage travel declined. In 1887, after 20 years, Alfred sold his
				Cosmopolitan Hotel and stables, and retired.</p

				<p
					>Alonzo was famed for revitalizing the New Town project. By
					the time that Alonzo step of the steamer onto the wharf in
					San Diego, the area was dubbed "Davis's Folly", after one of
					the New Town developer. The most prominent building was the
					wharf itself. Other buildings were mostly abandoned.
				</p>
				<p
					>Alonzo understood, however, the chief advantages of San
					Diego was its natural bay. Old Town, which was establish
					close to the Presidio Hill, had access to the San Diego
					River but required a long trip to travel down to the Bay.
					Therefore, he began buying up the land surrounding the wharf
					and re-start the New Town development.</p
				>
				<p
					>Alonzo's succeed could be partially attribute to his
					boosterism belief. Alonzo had long suffer from a persistance
					cold. His initial travel to San Diego was in hope of
					improving his health. His health did get better. The other
					reason for his suceed was a mini gold rush when gold was
					found in the Julian mountain in 1870s. The flock of gold
					seeker cause a big boost for the port and New Town business.
