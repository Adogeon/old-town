						building as their headquarters. Between 1850 and 1870,

				<p
					>President James Polk enlisted Mormon volunteers to serve in
					a battalion and help with the Mexican War effort in the
					West. They bolstered the ranks of the United States Army and
					its continuing effort in the Mexican American War. These
					volunteers were recruited to assist while parts of the
					Mormon community were beginning to settle further West into
					Mexican territory. When the battalion started their march
					from Iowa in 1846, the Mormon church members did not have
					any foothold in the West. After the march began, a large
					contingent of church members, unconnected to the battalion,
					travelled to Utah to make Salt Lake City the headquarters
					for the Church of Latter-Day Saints. Members of the Mormon
					Battalion ended up all over the West Coast, with some
					specifically landing in San Diego. The battalion arrived in
					San Diego on January 27, 1847, about two weeks after the
					signing of the Treaty of Cahuenga in Los Angeles on January
					13, 1847, which ended the fighting in California. The
					enlistment papers, for many within the battalion, required
					their military service continue until July 1847. As a
					result, many stayed in San Diego to help with public service
					projects like building the courthouse.</p
