	<h1>Restoration Effort</h1>

	<section>
		<h3>The Beginning</h3>
		<section
			><p>
				The restoration effort of San Diego can be traced by a novel. In
				1884, Helen Hunt Jackson's best-selling novel, Ramona stir
				public interest in California's Spanish past. Tourist flock to
				Casa de Estilla out of mistaken belief that the cahpel had once
				been the setting for the marriage between Ramona and her Indian
				lover Alessandro. By that time, the Estudillos had moved to Los
				Angeles and the house in Old Town was in disrepair. In 1906 John
				Spreckels purchased the house for $500. John Spreckels hired
				Hazel Wood Waterman to restore the building.</p

			<h3>The architect's vision</h3>
			<p>
				Waterman wasn't a liscensed architect but a gifted designer. She
				was an accomplished painter and a published author on adobe
				structured. Most importantly, she had a vision about southern
				California's early Hispanic heritage that was considerably
				romanticized. Waterman's vision of the house was mroe focus on
				the Estudillo's family and their supposed aristocracy lifestyle.
				In her effort, she pioneered the use of traditional building
				methods and materials. Although she did took creative license in
				her landscape design. Flowers were planted instead more
				functional plants. She also added features suchas the fountain,
				walkways, arbors, and adobe walls.

		<h3>The promoter's angle</h3>
		<p
			>In 1910, when the project complete, Spreckels leased the property
			to Tommy Getz who play up the Ramona angle to attackt more tourist.
			The Estudillo family questioned the Getz's managements. Especially
			his emphasis on a legendary romance rather that the history of a
			real family. In direct answer to such complain, the promoter state
			that the public care more about the story of Ramona then the actual
			history of the Estudillo's family. The Ramona crazed lasted into the
			late 1930s.

		<h3>The tourist spot</h3>
		<div>
			<p>
				Nowaday, while the pergola, wagon wheels, and other Ramona
				paraphernalia have been removed, historic preservation faces a
				different challenge. Old Town has evoled into a major touries
				destinations with dozens of concessions. The light, the shpe,
				the paved walkways create an alluring but false historical
				setting. The noise and pollutants from the surrounding freeways
				and the maze of parking lots further detract from the park's
				historic setting. Old Town's history became more and more
				abstract day by day.</p
