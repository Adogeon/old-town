				The Mexican pueblo de San Diego officially become a town in
				1834. However, it quickly lost its status in four years later.
			</p>
			<p
				>How the town lost its citizen can be explained by examine three
				Califronios family: the Bandini, the Estudillo, and the
				Machado.</p
			>
			<p
				>All three are rancho families and their ranchos are far away
				from the town. Even though all three have houses facing the
				central plaze, indicates that they were outstanding member of
				the community; these houses are more likely not their main
				residency. They are more likely to spend more time in their
				rancho and only come to town for special occations.</p
			>
			<p
				>If that is the case for influencing members of the community
				then for other ranchos, they would probably moved out of the
				town all together to stay nearer to their ranchos.</p
